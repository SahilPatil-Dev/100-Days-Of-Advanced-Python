# 100-Days-Of-Advanced-Python
A 100-day deep dive into advanced Python concepts through experiments, internals, and real-world use cases.

## Day 01 – Python Execution Model & Memory References

### What I Learned
- Python variables do not store values, they reference objects
- Difference between mutable and immutable objects
- Why assignment does not create a copy
- How function arguments work internally

### Key Insight
Most Python bugs are not syntax problems — they are reference problems.

### Files
- `memory_references.py` → experiments with object identity and mutation

This foundation is critical for writing clean, predictable, and scalable Python code.

## Day 02 – Mutability Traps & Default Arguments

### What I Learned
- Default arguments are evaluated once at function definition
- Mutable defaults cause shared state bugs
- The `None` pattern prevents hidden side effects
- Class constructors are especially risky with mutable defaults

### Key Insight
Defaults belong to the function object, not the function call.

### Files
- `default_arguments.py` → experiments demonstrating shared state bugs


## Day 03 – Functions as First-Class Objects  
### Behavior as Data in Python

---

### What I Learned

- Functions in Python are objects and can be:
  - Assigned to variables
  - Stored in data structures
  - Passed as arguments
  - Returned from other functions
- This allows programs to choose behavior dynamically at runtime instead of hard-coding logic with conditionals.

---

### Key Concepts Practiced

- Using dictionaries to map operations to functions
- Passing functions as arguments to execute dynamic behavior
- Returning functions from factory functions
- Building configurable logic without `if / elif` chains

---

### Why This Matters

Modern backend systems rely on treating **behavior as data**.

Frameworks such as FastAPI and Django use this pattern to implement:
- Dependency injection
- Middleware pipelines
- Permission and authorization checks
- Request validation layers

Understanding functions as first-class objects is foundational for writing **clean, extensible, and testable backend code**.

### Files

- **function_executor.py**  
  Dynamic operation execution using function mappings.

- **permission_checker.py**  
  Function factory for role-based permission checks.

- **validator_engine.py**  
  Rule-based validation using lists of validator functions.
